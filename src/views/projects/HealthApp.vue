    <p>
      Final year project of my Web Technology degree in which I achieved a high first.
      A distributed system using Vue.js as the frontend as a Progressive Web App (PWA). 
      The PWA is a single page application that utilises a Python Django Framework backend 
      REST API to enable text and video chat and a database of common health conditions which is searchable offline.

   <p>From the project report:</p>
   <p>
     A responsive company website, an Android app, an IOS app. 
     The minimum three platforms in 2020 that most companies will develop, release, and maintain to engage as many users as they can. 
     Development time and cost can be significant to the company and often the end user experience can be fragmented across the company's web and device ecosystem.
     
     </p>
     <p>This report examines and details the use of modern web technologies to propose a single web application solution. 
     The web app is a website that can be visited conventionally by a web browser but additionally can be installed on the user&rsquo;s desktop PC, 
     Chromebook, Android and IOS devices. It is intended to replicate the experience that users expect on a native device by being very fast and responsive to user actions and have offline functionality.
     To demonstrate the advantages of this approach and the best use of the web technologies used, 
     a website has been developed with the function of acting as a national healthcare provider&rsquo;s 
     first port-of-call to the public when they are seeking health advice, require important contacts or looking to speak to
      healthcare professionals in real time. 
      </p>
      <p>The project is intended to highlight how open source web technologies 
      can be utilised to offer a user experience that parallels that of a native application in the context of a 
      scalable distributed system intended for use by the general public.
