          <p>Before graduating from <a href="/">CCCU</a>, I freelanced as a full stack web developer, which has given me an excellent grounding in a wide range of languages, development tools, software development lifecycle techniques and contributed to me achieving the highest grade in my studies. </p>  
          <p>Post-graduation, I've continued freelancing and been in full-time employment in a start-up environment. 
            The role has also required a broad range of other languages, knowledge of backend system architectures, network/general advanced HTTP and deployment pipelines. Since joinimgm, I have planned and implemented several large web apps with a small team.</p>
          <p>As well as strong programming and technical knowledge, being a developer for several SMEs has awarded me valuable experience in customer relations and project management and has brought many challenges that have had to be overcome and dealt with in a professional manner, often with short deadlines and always to a high standard.</p>
